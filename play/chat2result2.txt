To find the slowest API, you should use the `.ds-metrics-apm.transaction` index. This index contains data about transactions, which include information about the duration of the transaction. You can use the following query to find the slowest API:

```
{
  "size": 1,
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "duration.us": {
        "gte": 0
      }
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "duration.us": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This query will return the transaction with the longest duration, which is likely to be the slowest API.
