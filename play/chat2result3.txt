You should use the `.ds-metrics-apm.transaction` index and query for transactions with the slowest response times. For example, you could use the following query:

```
{
  "size": 10,
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "duration.us": {
        "gt": 1000000
      }
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "duration.us": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  ]
}
``` 364
