To find your slowest API, you should use the `.ds-metrics-apm.transaction` index. This index contains information about all recorded transactions, including their duration, name, and other metrics.

You can use the following query to find the slowest API:

```
{
  "size": 1,
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "type": "transaction"
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "duration": {
        "order": "desc"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This query will return the single slowest transaction that has been recorded. If you want to find multiple results, you can increase the size of the query.
